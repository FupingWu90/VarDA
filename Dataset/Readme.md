# Usage

## C0 dataset

This dataset was from the [MS-CMRSeg2019 challenge:](http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zhuangxiahai/0/mscmrseg19/) ;
The 35 labeled data was all cropped into 192\time 192;
This dataset was used as the source data


## LGE dataset
This dataset was from  the [MS-CMRSeg2019 challenge:](http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zhuangxiahai/0/mscmrseg19/);
The 45 labeled data was all cropped into 192\time 192;
These 45 images was used as the target data;
images of id 1-5 with labels were used as validation dataset, and the other were used as training and test dataset (transductive learning).
